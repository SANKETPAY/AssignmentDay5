-- Create College-info table
CREATE TABLE College_info (
college_code NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
college_name VARCHAR2(50),
address VARCHAR2(100)
);
-- Create Faculty-info table with college_code as a foreign key referencing College_info
CREATE TABLE Faculty_info (
college_code NUMBER,
faculty_code NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
faculty_name VARCHAR2(50),
qualification VARCHAR2(50),
experience_in_years NUMBER,
address VARCHAR2(100),
FOREIGN KEY (college_code) REFERENCES College_info(college_code)
);
-- Sample data for College_info
INSERT INTO College_info VALUES (1, 'ABC College', '123 Main Street, City');
INSERT INTO College_info VALUES (2, 'XYZ College', '456 Oak Street, Town');
-- Sample data for Faculty_info
