CREATE TABLE Student (
roll_no NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
marks NUMBER,
category VARCHAR2(50),
district VARCHAR2(50),
state VARCHAR2(50)
);
-- Create Student_rank table
CREATE TABLE Student_rank (
roll_no NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
marks NUMBER,
rank NUMBER
);
-- Sample data for Student
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 85, 'General', 'District_A', 'Tamilnadu');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 95, 'OBC', 'District_B', 'Andhra Pradesh');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (3, 105, 'SC', 'District_C', 'Tamilnadu');
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (4, 120, 'General', 'District_D', 'Andhra Pradesh');
-- Sample data for Student_rank
INSERT INTO Student_rank VALUES (1, 85, 150);
INSERT INTO Student_rank VALUES (2, 95, 80);
INSERT INTO Student_rank VALUES (3, 105, 120);
INSERT INTO Student_rank VALUES (4, 120, 30);
-- (i) Query to list all those students from Tamilnadu with a rank above 100
SELECT *
FROM Student s
JOIN Student_rank sr ON s.roll_no = sr.roll_no
WHERE s.state = 'Tamilnadu' AND sr.rank > 100;
-- (ii) Query to list all those students from Andhra Pradesh with a given category and rank
above 100
SELECT *
FROM Student s
JOIN Student_rank sr ON s.roll_no = sr.roll_no
