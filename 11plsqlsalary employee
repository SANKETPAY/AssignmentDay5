11. The organization has decided to increase the salary of employees by 10% of existing
salary, whose existing salary is less than Rs. 10000/-
Write a PL/SQ block to update the salary as per above requirement, display an appropriate
message based on the no. of rows affected by this update (using implicit cursor status
variables).
-- Assuming you have an Employee table with columns EmployeeID, Name, Salary
-- Create a sample Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
EmployeeID NUMBER,
Name VARCHAR2(50),
Salary NUMBER
);
-- Insert some sample records into Employee table
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 8000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 12000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Bob Johnson', 9500);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (4, 'Alice Brown', 11000);
-- PL/SQL block to update salary and display message
DECLARE
v_rows_affected NUMBER;
BEGIN
-- Update salary for employees with existing salary less than Rs. 10000
UPDATE Employee
SET Salary = Salary + (Salary * 0.10)
WHERE Salary < 10000;
-- Get the number of rows affected by the update
v_rows_affected := SQL%ROWCOUNT;
-- Display appropriate message based on the number of rows affected
IF v_rows_affected = 0 THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No employees with salary less than Rs. 10000 were found.');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_rows_affected || ' employee(s) have had their salary increased by
10%.');
END IF;
-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
